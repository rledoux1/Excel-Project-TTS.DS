Abstract 
This paper describes three business analytics projects using publicly available data. Each project is 
relatively small in scope and focuses on several specific skills within Microsoft Excel, yet flexible enough 
that they could be easily modified to accommodate more in-depth analysis. These projects may be used
as additional classroom practice or assessment focusing on critical thinking skills that will help prepare 
students for their future careers in all disciplines upon graduation. 
Keywords: Microsoft Excel, data analysis, data analytics, business analytics, analytics project, teaching 
case
1. INTRODUCTION
With the increasing demand of data analysis and 
data presentation skills in the workplace, college 
graduates are required to demonstrate their 
proficiency in these areas upon entering the 
workforce (Arnett, 2017). As one of the most 
popular productivity software packages in the 
world, Microsoft Excel is one of the required 
digital skills that can help a candidate find a job
(Weber, 2015). 
There are many resources to learn about 
Microsoft Excel. Many of these materials focus on 
how to do certain tasks using the program. Some 
practice and follow up assignments provide 
opportunities for students to apply what they 
have learned in different scenarios. However, 
these task-based practice materials are still far 
from what students will encounter when working 
in real-world organizations. 
This paper presents three data analysis projects
using Microsoft Excel. These assignments are 
designed to focus on higher-level learning where 
students apply the computer skills to real world 
scenarios using publicly available data. Students 
are also required to use Microsoft Excel to analyze 
data and interpret the results of their analysis in 
order to find answers to the questions. 
The next sections describe the three analytics 
projects in more detail. Each project starts with 
a short introduction followed by the list of 
prerequisite skills, i.e., what students should 
already know how to use on Microsoft Excel. The 
case scenario is described next, followed by the 
project requirements. 
2. EXCEL ANALYTICS PROJECT 1 –

7. Format cells content, background, and 
borders
8. Prepare and format a worksheet for printing
Case Scenario
One day at a family dinner, your dad and your 
uncle got into a debate about which basketball 
team is better. Your dad is a loyal fan of the State 
University while your uncle graduated from the 
University of State, a big rival of the State 
University. Your great aunt chimed in that the 
University of Next- State’s basketball team is the 
best.
You mentioned that there are multiple different 
ways you can compare the performance of the 
basketball teams and you will bring in your 
analysis to the next family dinner. 
Project Requirements
1. Please watch the “What is Benchmarking?” 
video to learn about Benchmarking, an 
approach used by many organizations to 
measure and compare themselves with 
others. The video is available at 
https://youtu.be/R6tJpyaFiQc. 
2. Visit the College Basketball Stats and History 
website at http://www.sportsreference.com/cbb/. Select three 
comparable college men’s basketball teams 
(to represent the three college teams from 
the above scenario) and locate their latest 
complete season statistics on the website. 
3. Using Microsoft Excel, please conduct a 
benchmarking study comparing the 
performance of the three men’s basketball 
teams side-by-side.
4. For each of the three teams, locate statistics 
that represents each TEAM's, not conference, 
performance. At the minimum, please 
include the following performance indicators 
for each team:
a. Number of games won
b. Number of games lost
c. PTS -- Total Points
d. G -- Games (i.e., number of games 
played during the season)
e. FG% -- Field Goal Percentage
f. 2P% -- 2-Point Field Goal Percentage
g. TOV -- Total Turnovers
5. Please write an Excel formula to calculate the 
following statistics for each team:
a. Win-lose percentage (W-L%) = 
Number of games won / Total number 
of games played
b. Average points per game = Total 
Points / Total number of games 
played
c. Average Turnovers per Game = Total 
Turnovers / Total number of games 
played
6. Provide TWO additional performance 
indicators that you think are appropriate. 
7. Use clear titles, labels, sheet name, and other 
appropriate spreadsheet formats (e.g., font 
type, size, colors, borders, etc.) so users can 
easily locate the information. 
8. Include appropriate information on the Page 
Header and Page Footer
9. Apply appropriate settings so that all 
information will be printed on one page.
10. Use information from your analysis to 
answer the following questions:
a. According to the data, which team had 
the highest Win-lose percentage (WL%)?
b. According to the data, which team had 
the highest Field Goal Percentage (FG%)?
c. What is the Average Points per Game for 
the State University, i.e., your dad’s 
favorite team, during the most recent
season?
d. What is the Average Turnovers per Game 
for the University of State, i.e., your 
uncle’s favorite team, during the most 
recent season?
e. According to the data, which team had 
the best performance in the most recent
season when it comes to Turnovers? 
Note: In basketball, a turnover occurs 
when a team loses possession of the ball 
to the opposing team before a player 
takes a shot at his team's basket.
f. Discussion: What were the two additional 
performance indicators that you 
selected? Why did you choose these
indicators and which team performed the 
best according to these indicators? 
Please explain your answer.
g. Discussion: According to your 
spreadsheet, which performance 
indicator do you think is the most 
important for this analysis and 
why? Please explain your answer.
h. Discussion: Among the three teams, 
which team do you think performed the 
best during the season and why? Please 
explain your answer using information 
from the analyses you conducted on the 
spreadsheet.
11. Save the Excel file and submit it as required 
by your instructor.
